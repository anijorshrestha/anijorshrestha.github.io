The Barclays Premier League BPL also known as English Premier League was launched in 1992, 20 teams fights with each other, each club plays their opponents twice in a season, one match home and the other one away, equaling 38 matches during the course of the entire season.

In Premier League there are the huge number of world-class players, the different football styles among most teams, fighting to earn one of the most respectful trophy. Premier League games has unpredictable outcomes(recent West Ham 1-0 Spurs), so it is difficult to predict which team stands first and which 3 teams goes for relegation, as opposed to other leagues such as LA Liga where the top two teams (Barcelona and Real Madrid) always seem to win every week.

The Premier League teams that finish in the bottom three of the standings each season are relegated to the second tier of English soccer, known as the Championship(Sunderland is relegated this season). The top four teams qualify for the UEFA Champions League, which is the most high-profile club football tournament in the world featuring the best teams from Europe competing against each other from the group stages through to the final in May. 

Current Standing of Premier League Clubs can be viewed from this site http://www.skysports.com/premier-league-table. As you can see top four teams (Till date Chelsea,Spurs,City,Liverpool ,this will be changed since PL is unpredictable )qualify for the Champions League. The fifth-placed team in the Premier League automatically qualifies for the UEFA Europa League, and the sixth and seventh-placed teams can also qualify, depending on the winners and runners-up of the two competitions FA Cup and League Cup; if the winner of the FA Cup qualifies for the Champions League, then that place will go to the runner-up, and if the runner-up is also already qualified, then that place will go to the next-best placed finisher in the Premier League. If the winner of the League Cup has already qualified, that place goes to the next-best placed team in the league.
