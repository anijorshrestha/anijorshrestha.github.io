When Chelsea won Premier league title this season, I cried not just because of  victory we have conquered but by the emotional speech by the Captain. Not just me but all Chelsea fan as well as people who admired you were heart broken.

I know I became fan of Chelsea because of Lampard , after Drogba you were the person whom I admired most at Chelsea. I did not knew much about your history, but after following the trail , you became one of the inspirational person for me. Giving so much to the club from the beginning and now you are here as one of the best center back, you truly are our Captain.

Those 22 years you gave to Chelsea proves that how much you love Chelsea , You are irreplacable.
