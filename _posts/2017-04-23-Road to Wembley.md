Yesterday was one hell of the match between Chelsea and Spurs with the full time score Chelsea 4-2 Tottenham. Recently loosing Manchester United 2-0 and the winning streak of Spurs were surely making every Chelsea fan go scared. But still we have faith in our Godfather "Conte", the mastermind who took Chelsea all the way to Top. 


After seeing the lineup , I was literally shocked seeing Hazard on the bench. I couldn't care less about Costa, but thought Conte has seriously gone mental by resting our best player in a cup semifinal against the most in form team in the league. Not even fabregas? I asked myself "Seriously ? WHyyy??". Conte's strategy, the way I see it: Just hang in there until half time. Introduce our big guns after the break and catch them by surprise. Spurs were expecting Hazard and preparing to nullify his threat all week. Conte surprises them with Willian and Michy. Disrupting their entire game plan. Either a masterclass or a disasterclass. Absolutely no in between. And it came to be true, Firsthalf was nervewrecking situtaion , the first four minute freekick by Willian was cancelled by Kane (I knew he would score) with the header. The penalty, fouled by Son to Willian was also cancelled by Alli. Both the teams were giving there all in the game,the pressure was so high not only to players but to all Chelsea and Spurs fan. 

Now the second half, I was just crossing my finger and saying myself "Bring Hazard PLeasee". After half an hour Conte played his card by bringing up the groundbreaking subs Hazard and Costa. Then I strongly felt, he will change this game. At 75 min , with corner given to Chelsea ,Hazard threads a stunning low fizzer through a thicket of players, across Lloris, and into the bottom right! What a finish that was! What a game we have on our hands here! That absolute minute , where Chelsea Nepal group got absolutely crazyy, what a releif!! But since every goal was cancelled we were praying to hold the game till the end. Within 5 minutes , I got to see one of the best goal,which the commentator said "no strongest goalkeeper on the Earth can save such a strike from Matic", most amazing goal from Matic. I felt no one could stop us now, we are going to Wembleyy. The goal can easily summed up by Zouma's incredible reaction. What a game it was !!!

Next we have City VS Arsenal, I hope for Arsenal to win (hehehe !!!). Can't wait to catch the doubles :P
